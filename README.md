# tiny_timer
I needed basic simple Time Count down plugin, was too lazy find and custamize as my requirements are very simple and basic. so build my own

Include the DIV with giver ID's
Include the SCRIPT
I assume the <span id=""remHours></span> -- contains remaining Hours and <span id="remMins"></span>  -- contains remaining Mins and so on..
